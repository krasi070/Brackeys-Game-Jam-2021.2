<h3>Initial Idea</h3>
<p>
The team for this game jam was "Let there be chaos". Our idea was to make a WarioWare-like game where you change between different mini-games to make the game feel a bit more hectic. On top of that the story would compliment the theme by having the player try to get earn affection of their crush who only likes bad chaotic guys. The end result was Chaotic Crush!
</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Pursue your crush through a set of 6 mini-games encompassing classic arcade-y video games and a few wacky scenarios. However, it's not going to be so simple to convince your crush of your many charms. She's only into bad, chaotic kinda guys, which might prove a problem for you. You're going to have to prove yourself!
</p>
<p>
The twist of the game is that you are not required to beat the mini-games. Quite the opposite, you have to fail them in order to show your crush the kinda guy you are. Well, are you ready to give it a shot?
